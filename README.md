# min-max_nutrition
In this project I'm trying to answer this question: What is the combination of unprocessed food that has all of the recommended daily vitamin/minerals that has the fewest calories?

In the "results.txt" as well as the main jupyter file, I've come up with some relatively satisfying answers. However, I've decided to leave this project alone for a little bit. I'll come back after some time working on something else, and I'll get some better answers and try to formulate some recipes.
